# Contest Scoreboard Database

This project consists of a database for storing data about the scoreboard of a fictional programming contest similar to [ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/). It also contains a GUI for executing CRUD operations. The project was developed as the last assignment of the IMD0041 - BANCO DE DADOS (databases) course.
